Initially, this concept concerned a personal (or at least trying to be) objectivity of myself, and a simple situation similar to that found in the 45 second short, “<a href="../../film/sarika/" target="_blank">Sarika Sabnis</a>”, but replaced with me in the Northloop. Noncomplex, arguably autobiographical. Certainly of a situation I was in, at least conceptually.
<br><br>
That foremost idea would casually follow a character through his night ritual of ignoring the world, biking to the neighborhood coffeeshop (while likely reflecting on this wilful ignorance), spending some time there, chatting with the staff and patrons, then returning home to muddle around the house/his room until morning. A simple idea whose runtime likely wouldn’t exceed a couple of minutes. Honestly, I should have just executed on this and moved along my merry way.
<br><br>
This initial offering was then amalgamated with a philosophical drama regarding a character similar to the first, but in an argumentative discussion inside their head with a projection of some subjective objectivity on the state of the universe, derived from within. Retrospectively this seems oddly far fetched and ill benefitting, ultimately, the kinds of stories I would like to express through cinema. The feelings associated with this concept, I think, remain relevant. The realization, however, is amiss, and muddled with a philosophical melodrama I’m not fond of. Again, the subject matter isn’t bad, but the foundation was flawed.
<br><br>
Once again failing to execute on this iteration, where the title, “What Do You Think About When You’re Folding Laundry” was discovered, a third revision took place over the course of several weeks. Stuck on the flawed foundation (the projected character and story in the main character’s head, working this out to try and make any logical, or artistic sense) I think I began letting go of the concept altogether, to join a myriad of purgatorial ideas I’ve left in my wake over the last half decade. Then I met Callie, who had just recently moved to town, trying to go to school here (which was a mistake, we’ll touch on this more). Our friendship was short lived, and although lasting the duration of the semestre, I think we only met in person three times: 1) initial meeting in September, 2) downtown in October, 3) her apartment in November. However sporadic our encounters, the material of discussion oddly framed well within the initial idea for UP#7, something I hadn’t concluded until weeks of (likely subconscious) deliberation, assisted by the experiences laid out by dear Calandra. This conclusion, I mean, being the heart of UP#7: a philosophical (psychological?) idea of the home. Callie’s contributions were making apparent the strength one’s home has on them, even during stages wherein we’re attempting desperately to escape- which seemed to be her disposition. Born and raised in Green Bay, a product of stereotypical midwestern americana. She was painfully middle class, which is only an observation: striving for something new, but unable to escape (for various reasons: money, homesickness, laziness- many things I’ve had troubles with in the past). She had worked several jobs over the years, in hopes of saving something to pay for college, and hopefully, one day, make it out of the midwest. The nature of Callie’s decision makes complete sense to me, but the rationality, all things considered, makes absolutely no sense. Neither her nor her family could afford the ludicrous endeavour. Austin is too expensive, tuition and cost of living. This resulted in a requirement for various loans, which, with no money, and in an understudy like Graphic Design, the duration of these would outlive her 20s, or the entirety of her youth. Indeed, another indentured servant of the government. And Callie knew this, ultimately returning to Green Bay at the end of the semestre, after a series of sad, but by no means devastating events. Her dog died (in Green Bay), and upon returning to Austin found her Hamster dead as well. But, alas, she confided that her brief time visiting home was so comfortable and stress-free that she very easily decided to return before the end of the year. Callie claims that her time here mostly consisted of staying inside, on her couch, watching the TV. She never went in her own bedroom out of some surely apparated fear. She’d also admitted during our final encounter that she had accrued zero friends over her months abroad, here in Austin.
<br><br>
The importance of Calandra’s situation as a whole, and ultimate, predestined return to the midwest is in its contrast to her beginnings in Austin. The first time we talked, for several hours, Calandra’s outlook on her current and upcoming semestre was met with supreme optimism. Honestly, rightfully so- there’s no fault in her positivity. I can cloud my judgments with some elitist derision for those who rashly make decisions like Callies, but I can’t ignore the feelings and subsequent motivations associated with it. For Calandra, at the beginning of her stay, these were obvious. I recall a pivotal moment in our first discussion where I expressed to her a dreadful case of my own fruition inquiring inward and outward the need to understand our existence, or plainly existence in and of itself. I remember telling her about the initial idea for UP#7, and my motivations for it, and feelings inspiring those motivations. That is, upon final contemplation, assuming a wandering mind, Humans will think about our existence, and likely the inevitable lack thereof- peering into the abyss. Callie didn’t take very strongly to my self labeled “existential” declaration, or those revolving around, shortly thereafter abandoning the discussion entirely to continue getting high.
<br><br>
Our second outing didn’t hold very much weight, but is perhaps important due to its classically ambiguous arbitrarity. However, the third and final interaction with Calandra was what solidified this iteration of UP#7, and likely holds some factor in the development of the current one. Callie had, in reflection of her time in Austin, and after a weekend back home, utterly and completely contradicted quite literally everything she had proclaimed at the beginning of the semestre. In fact, upon reference to our own conversation, Callie agreed with my sentiment regarding the nature of Human thought. Her requirement to be home, made apparent by her recent visit back, was just icing on the cake. Thus, in full retrospection of the whole of me and Callie’s transpondence, this iteration of UP#7 was supremely born, having slowly brewed over the past couple of months.
This iteration, which base will be henceforth known as “UP#7 Classic”, held a special place in my thoughts. For a couple, maybe 3 months, I sat on this anticipating to realize the project in the spring. During this time many emandations were made, largely small, the most notable being an addition of a “Sarika Sabnis” like creature, in correspondence with our main character throughout, probably with a reunion somewhere or sometime. With that, we have UP#7 Classic, built up from the iterative beginning mentioned foremost here.
<br><br>
Towards the end of my settling on UP7c, and surrender to time, ie; concluding the proper realization of this piece would need much more planning, with potentiality for feature length- that is, I wouldn’t restrain creative development for durationsake- I decided exactly that: the film could not be made. At least not soon. In fact, this is the second time I’ve come to such revelations, first being last year at the end of fall, when it became clear the film couldn’t be made by the end of the 2018 (as was initially intended). In reflection, I’m sometimes startled by the level of grandeurity I possess in relation to project timelines. From this revelation sprouted a few things, pertaining to or influenced by. In regards to the pertinent, a desire to fully realize the piece, patiently, eliciting a required shelving, to be mulled on for the coming months, maybe years.
<br><br>
In final, UP7c would indeed join the purgatorial myriad. I do hope to revisit someday, made logarithmically less likely each step towards the current iteration. However, this story concept was essential to the evolution of UP#7.
<br><br>
The transition- months away from UP7c and towards UP#7 were littered with a fascination for Japanese cinema. The amount I watched was subpar (~2 Kurosawa, 7 Ozu, 1 Mizoguchi), but the impact was great. I believe this is a condition of many different films and directors- I’ll watch one of them, and assuming an emotional response, will take days off to continue thinking and feeling about the piece. I do believe I’m getting over this, and being allowed to watch several in daily sequence while still maintaining psychological resonance. Nonetheless, these films likely had an impact towards some development of the current project.
<br><br>
Upon return of dear Sarika Sabnis to Austin, and weeks of reappropriation, I found her existence to be of greater impact than her absence. Which, makes complete sense. Her presence must be making a massive impact if her absence was as well.. Right?
<br><br>
Another piece to this endlessly cascading puzzle is Sarika's home for the next few weeks: the Avalon co-op. Not only because of its cooperative housing charm, but also it’s soon to be cease of existence. By the end of the summer the entire property will be demolished. Knowledge of this was especially pressing for me, and initialized feelings which would have me delay other (arguably more lucrative, eg. Cowtown Classics) projects to, hopefully, produce a short documentary on the house, which has been around since the ‘80s. I feel a similar sentiment to documenting this co-op as I do for the familial documentation, and CC. Almost as a duty, but that to me sounds blowhardy or arrogant. At the end of the day I feel some part of art is selfish for the creator. And I have my thoughts and reasons, one being a give/take for the co-op organization of filming a short doc, in exchange receiving approval to shoot some UP#7 scenes on their property. Only a few. Also, producing a half-decent short doc on an Austin/UT establishment might be beneficial for the portfolio; good subject for practice. But I digress, Sarika’s stay there has been an influence, and allowed me to see this project more clearly.
<br><br>
I don’t feel I’ve built up the totality of preface required to understand in full the ultimate birth of what is the current iteration of UP#7.. but I’ve tried my best, leaving- finally -the review and subsequent description of this project.
<br><br>
UP#7 is, at its core, autobiographical, as was the first iteration. I would compare this version to that one most of all, but stretched and bent to match what I believe to be a much more thorough and beautiful concept. Perhaps more universal as well. I would like to, however, first address the potential autobiographicality and subsequent issues it presents. To me, there are none. Striking a story that is close to home, if not entirely based upon experiences of the creator, is to me the heart of art. I will say, though, the problems commence when the artist begins interjecting their subjective hand on the world which would rather be left to its objectivity. Clearly, this is impossible in and of itself, but the degree to which they can balance (or wholly eliminate) that hand with the reality they’re presenting, the closer- perhaps -they will allow themselves to reach masterpietical perfection. I digress on the front that some artists strive for a prominence of this hand, but I can’t speak to that. All I can say is, for myself, the former is the ultimate, unreachable goal. I must also mention the need to explain myself on these grounds is derived from reading about other artists doing similar acts (see Tarkovsky), and being ridiculed for such. And the derision behind this remains largely unclear to me, except for what I’ve laid out here.
<br><br>
UP#7 remains an enigma. The last couple of months, during its primary subconcial development, what Tarkovsky would depict as “moments of illumination” have taken place, many times. This also happened with previous iterations, chiefly the first. I’ve done myself a favor and attempted noting moments of these occurrences. At this point, I think it’s high time to begin stringing these together in hope of realizing a piece which, in its entirety, encompases the multitude of these illuminations, that I feel all share a very similar sentiment ending with an amalgam that rings as real and true as its contents suggest.. And ultimately are. The basic ideas and feeling I’m suggesting are, I think, some that most everyone have at some time experienced themselves. Lonesome out of voluntary isolation, and longing for “home”, or perhaps something we’ve attributed closely therein (ie. a significant other). A crawl through the days, filled with nothing, or what could be assumed as much. But that assumption would be incorrect. It’s usually not what happens on one day, and if it is, there is more that plays into those singular events. This isn’t to discredit stories that occur on one occasion, in fact many of those are my favorites- I would, though, like to take a crack at portraying a story of this structure (extended over a longer period of time), as many like this have made significant impact on my psyche, and to some degree I feel that my subconscious likes to develop these on its own. Thus begging the necessity to attempt an aforementioned molding of these “illuminations”. I should clarify this “nothingness” in it’s falsehood becomes more clear as the story goes on, to a realization, perhaps, that the wholality, filled or absent with action, is necessary.
<br><br>
The plot, if it could be called, concerns a boy of his early twenties, meandering through the spring, with no clear objective or direction, experiencing something like the simple mundanities of a young life. Few responsibilities. Not drowning- floating, down a stream which, day by day, fills slightly more, becoming a river, ending in the ocean- the abyss. The duration of this journey is unknown, but we’re all there, and we’re all wading in an illusion of our own fruition (clear influence from the second iteration, “WDYTAWYFL”- what eventually irked me from this was it’s lack of subtly and blending into the reality of our illusion. But I believe it’s recognition will suffice as a correction in future development). This young person is tied with some extended spiritual bond with another of similar age, apparent by many things which will be mentioned later, but can be easily assumed from any other healthy, youthful relationship. This, however, holds its own emotional weight which contains and causes effects of its own- whether good or bad, or ultimately neither. What I’ve stolen most, but plan to expand on, is the character from our first iteration. He is voluntarily confined to his room, with occasional journeys to the local coffee shop, bookstore, and university to visit his bon ami. Many of these incantations are, although inspired by personal experience, more fantasy from daydream on these inspirations.
<br><br>
I quite literally have no idea where best to begin, but I also reckon, perhaps, that answer does not exist. And if in a lack of existence, where’s best to begin is anywhere. And again, if we assume an average of our character’s time is spent at this home, perhaps that’s where were are. And thus, we begin.
